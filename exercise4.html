<h1>"Hello"</h1>


<span>Hello, it's me</span>
<br>

<span>I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet</span>
<br>
<span>To go over everything</span><br>
<span>They say that time's supposed to heal ya</span><br>
<span>But I ain't done much healing</span><br>
<span>Hello, can you hear me?</span><br>
<span>I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be</span><br>
<span>When we were younger and free</span><br>
<span>I've forgotten how it felt</span><br>
<span>Before the world fell at our feet</span><br>
